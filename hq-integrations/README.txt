== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

Target audience of this plugin is mainly theme developers that to create a portfolio theme or want to add portfolio functionality to an existing one.

= How is this plugin different from Jetpack portfolio module or similar plugins? =

This plugin is actually inspired by Jetpack portfolio module and [Portfolio Post Type](https://github.com/devinsays/portfolio-post-type) by Devin Price and Gary Jones. However, HQ Integrations is built with [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate), which follows a slightly different approach in building plugins. On top of that, HQ Integrations adds custom metabox with three fields.

= What fields are included? =

There are three meta boxes at the moment:
**Client** - Client name for the project (e.g. Apple)
**URL** - Link to a live project (e.g. http://www.apple.com/)

= Does this plugin include any templates? =

No, it doesn't. However, you can easily create your own in your theme (or child theme).
